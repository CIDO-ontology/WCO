# WCO-2020: Workshop on COVID-19 Ontologies
(Eighth Annual Workshop of the Clinical and Translational Science Ontology Group)

## Announcement: 
COVID-19 is the first pandemic in the big data and AI era, and has resulted in unprecedented cooperation among global teams in the race to find cures. This has come with interesting data challenges, not just in the scale, but also in the variety of the data that is being generated and shared - data that is often generated using different models. Integration at this massive scale requires a coordinated effort by the clinical, research, government, informatics and other communities. This workshop on COVID-19 ontologies aims to bring together all the interested parties to share their experiences, ontologies, applications, lessons learned, and encourage more coordinated efforts to build effective models for semantic data integration and insights globally. The first Workshop on COVID-19 Ontologies (WCO-2020) is part of the CTSA Ontology Group meeting series. We invite everyone to join the WCO-2020!   


We are happy to announce one or two keynote speakers (tentative):
Warren Kibbe (former NCI director and now in Duke) - for ontology development.
Mitra Rocca (FDA), or Michael Warters (FDA)  - for ontology applications.

Sessions: one on ontology development, one on ontology applications. 
Two different dates - can be one or two weeks apart.

This workshop will include the following themes (or sessions - time):
Development of COVID-19 ontologies 
Applications of ontologies, including: 
User interface
Query and analysis 
Visualization
Machine learning, AI, NLP
Demos of COVID-19 data usage and analysis (even if ontology is not used). The data can be clinical, research, social, economic, etc. 

Date: October 20 (Tuesday, tentative)
Note: first check with Barry and Bill and see if they work fine with the dates. 

## Venue: Online (virtual meeting)

## Submissions:
We welcome submissions of abstracts of 300 words or less for oral presentations and tool demos. Images can be included, but limit the whole submission to one page.
